# CLAUDE.md

Claude Code does not read `AGENTS.md` natively, so this file imports it. Everything in it applies here.

@AGENTS.md

## Claude Code specifics

Install the MeetStream MCP server so you are working against current API truth rather than this repo's files:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http meetstream https://mcp.meetstream.ai/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $MEETSTREAM_API_KEY"
```

Separately, the [MeetStream Claude plugin](https://github.com/meetstream-ai/claude-plugin) adds skills for notetakers, sales coaching, calendar automation and scaffolding. It ships **skills only** and does not include the MCP server, so the two are complementary rather than alternatives:

```sh
/plugin marketplace add meetstream-ai/claude-plugin
```

Confirm it is live with `/mcp`, then ask for `list_bots` - a clean response means the key and transport are both good.

## Keep these two files in sync

`CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` rather than duplicating it, so edit **`AGENTS.md`** and the change lands in both. Only Claude-Code-specific instructions belong in this file.
